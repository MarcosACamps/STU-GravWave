# STU-GravWave
## GW Dataset Retrieval 
- Runs loops for L1 (LIGO Livingston) and H1 (LIGO Hanford) to grab from list of signals. The signal data is then cleaned and transformed into spectrogram form which is saved to a given directory

## GW Machine Learning 2
- An old TensorFlow-based machine learning model used to identify whether or not a spectrogram is a gravitational wave.
